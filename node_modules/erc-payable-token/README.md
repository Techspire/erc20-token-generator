ERC-1363 allows to implement an ERC-20 token that can be used for payments.

This is an implementation of the [ERC-1363 Payable Token](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1363) that defines a token interface for ERC-20 tokens that supports executing recipient code after `transfer` or `transferFrom`, or spender code after `approve`.

## Abstract
There is no way to execute code after an ERC-20 transfer or approval (i.e. making a payment), so to make an action it is required to send another transaction and pay GAS twice.
ERC-1363 makes token payments easier and working without the use of any other listener. It allows to make a callback after a transfer or approval in a single transaction.

There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that can accept ERC-20 payments.

Examples could be:
* to create a token payable crowdsale
* selling services for tokens
* paying invoices
* making subscriptions

For these reasons it was named as **"Payable Token"**.

Anyway you can use it for specific utilities or for any other purposes who require the execution of a callback after a transfer or approval received.


## Install

```bash
npm install erc-payable-token
```

## Usage

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

import "erc-payable-token/contracts/token/ERC1363/ERC1363.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC1363 {

  constructor (string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC1363(name, symbol) {}

  // your stuff
}
```

### IERC1363

[IERC1363.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1363/IERC1363.sol)

Interface for a Payable Token contract as defined in [ERC-1363 Payable Token](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1363).

```solidity
interface IERC1363 is IERC20, IERC165 {
    function transferAndCall(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferAndCall(address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool);
    function transferFromAndCall(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFromAndCall(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool);
    function approveAndCall(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function approveAndCall(address spender, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool);
}
```

### ERC1363

[ERC1363.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1363/ERC1363.sol)

Implementation of an IERC1363 interface.

### IERC1363Receiver

[IERC1363Receiver.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1363/IERC1363Receiver.sol)

Interface for any contract that wants to support `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall` from ERC1363 token contracts.

```solidity
interface IERC1363Receiver {
    function onTransferReceived(address operator, address sender, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes4);
}
```

### IERC1363Spender

[IERC1363Spender.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1363/IERC1363Spender.sol)

Interface for any contract that wants to support `approveAndCall` from ERC1363 token contracts.

```solidity
interface IERC1363Spender {
    function onApprovalReceived(address sender, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes4);
}
```

### ERC1363Payable

[ERC1363Payable.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/payment/ERC1363Payable.sol)

Implementation proposal of a contract that wants to accept ERC1363 payments. It intercepts what is the ERC1363 token desired for payments and throws if another is sent.

It emits a `TokensReceived` event to notify the transfer received by the contract.

It also implements a `transferReceived` function that can be overridden to make your stuffs within your contract after a `onTransferReceived`.

It emits a `TokensApproved` event to notify the approval received by the contract.

It also implements a `approvalReceived` function that can be overridden to make your stuffs within your contract after a `onApprovalReceived`.

### ERC1363PayableCrowdsale

[ERC1363PayableCrowdsale.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/examples/ERC1363PayableCrowdsale.sol)

As example: an Implementation of a classic token Crowdsale, but paid with ERC1363 tokens instead of ETH.
